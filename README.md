# Loris
Loris is a stateful fuzz testing framework designed to explore and analyze baseband firmware.
See the README file in each subdirectory ([analyzer](https://github.com/SyNSec-den/Loris/tree/main/analyzer), [emulator](https://github.com/SyNSec-den/Loris/tree/main/emulator), and [fuzzer](https://github.com/SyNSec-den/Loris/tree/main/fuzzer)) to get started.
For details, please check out our paper, "Stateful Analysis and Fuzzing of Commercial Baseband Firmware" (IEEE S&P 2025).
